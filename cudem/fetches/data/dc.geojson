(QSI).  Woolpert collected lidar using their Leica HawkEye 4X (HE4X) topo-bathy lidar sensor that consists of a Chiroptera 4X (CH4X) sensor, with an additional Leica 40kHz deep bathymetric channel  to provide high density topo lidar.  The HE4X is a latest generation topographic and bathymetric lidar sensor. The system provides denser data than previous traditional bathymetric lidar systems. It is unique in its ability to acquire bathymetric lidar, topographic lidar and 4-band digital camera imagery simultaneously. The HE4X provided 300 kHz topographic data, an effective 140 kHz shallow bathymetric data and 40 kHz deep bathymetric data.  4-band 80 MP digital camera imagery was also collected simultaneously with the sensorâs RCD-30 camera.\n\nThe bathymetric and topographic lasers are independent and do not share an optical chain or receivers, so they are optimized for their specific function. As with any bathymetric lidar, maximum depth penetration is a function of water clarity and seabed reflectivity.  The HE4X is designed to penetrate to 3 times the secchi depth.  This is also represented as Dmax = 4/K, where K is the diffuse attenuation coefficient, and assuming K is between 0.1 and 0.3, a normal sea state and 15% seabed reflectance.\n\nBoth the topographic and bathymetric sub-systems use a palmer scanner to produce an elliptical scan pattern of laser points with a degree of incidence ranging from +/-14Â° (front and back) to +/-20Â° (sides), providing a 40Â° field of view.  This has the benefit of providing multiple look angles on a single pass and helps to eliminate shadowing effects. This can be of particular use in urban areas, where all sides of a building are illuminated, or for bathymetric features such as the sides of narrow water channels or features on the seafloor such as smaller objects and wrecks.  It also assists with penetration in the surf zone where the back scan passes the same ground location a couple of seconds after the front scan, allowing the areas of whitewater to shift.\n\nAll topo lidar data for this project were collected simultaneous to meet United States Geological Survey, Quality Level 1 (USGS QL1) with a minimum of 8 pts per square meter at an accuracy of 10cm RMSEz.  A minimum of 2 points per square meter were acquired for bathymetric lidar data.

(QSI).  Woolpert collected lidar using their Leica HawkEye 4X (HE4X) topo-bathy lidar sensor that consists of a Chiroptera 4X (CH4X) sensor, with an additional Leica 40kHz deep bathymetric channel  to provide high density topo lidar.  The HE4X is a latest generation topographic and bathymetric lidar sensor. The system provides denser data than previous traditional bathymetric lidar systems. It is unique in its ability to acquire bathymetric lidar, topographic lidar and 4-band digital camera imagery simultaneously. The HE4X provided 300 kHz topographic data, an effective 140 kHz shallow bathymetric data and 40 kHz deep bathymetric data.  4-band 80 MP digital camera imagery was also collected simultaneously with the sensorâs RCD-30 camera.\n\nThe bathymetric and topographic lasers are independent and do not share an optical chain or receivers, so they are optimized for their specific function. As with any bathymetric lidar, maximum depth penetration is a function of water clarity and seabed reflectivity.  The HE4X is designed to penetrate to 3 times the secchi depth.  This is also represented as Dmax = 4/K, where K is the diffuse attenuation coefficient, and assuming K is between 0.1 and 0.3, a normal sea state and 15% seabed reflectance.\n\nBoth the topographic and bathymetric sub-systems use a palmer scanner to produce an elliptical scan pattern of laser points with a degree of incidence ranging from +/-14Â° (front and back) to +/-20Â° (sides), providing a 40Â° field of view.  This has the benefit of providing multiple look angles on a single pass and helps to eliminate shadowing effects. This can be of particular use in urban areas, where all sides of a building are illuminated, or for bathymetric features such as the sides of narrow water channels or features on the seafloor such as smaller objects and wrecks.  It also assists with penetration in the surf zone where the back scan passes the same ground location a couple of seconds after the front scan, allowing the areas of whitewater to shift.\n\nAll topo lidar data for this project were collected simultaneous to meet United States Geological Survey, Quality Level 1 (USGS QL1) with a minimum of 8 pts per square meter at an accuracy of 10cm RMSEz.  A minimum of 2 points per square meter were acquired for bathymetric lidar data.

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.3. The data was developed based on the NAD83(2011) horizontal datum and NAVD88 (GEOID12B) vertical datum. Data was projected in UTM Zone 8N. All units are in meters. RAW flight line swaths were processed to create 2,390 classified LAS 1.4 files delineated in 1,000 m x 1,000 m tiles. Please note that tiles GB_03743 and GB_05552 do not include valid point return data as they are entirely over areas of open water and thus have not been included in this submission. Each LAS file contains Lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional derived products include hydro-flattened DEMs, Highest Hit DSMs, Intensity Images, DZ Orthos, Flightline Shapes, Swath Coverage Shapes, Ground Survey Shapes and 3D breaklines of rivers and lakes within the study area. \n\t\t\t\tGround Conditions: Lidar was collected in summer 2019, while the presence of snow on the ground was at a minimum and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the Lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, DOWL on behalf of QSI established a total of 194 ground control points distributed throughout the Glacier Bay Delivery 1 project area. Lidar data was calibrated to these known ground locations. An additional 115 independent accuracy checkpoints, 33 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (NVA points) and 82 in Shrub, Tall Grass, and Forest categories (VVA points) were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the project data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.\n\nNote: currently only Delivery 1 of 2 has been released (Blocks 2 & 3, collected in 2019).

This Classified LAS v1.4 data set was used to create; hydro-flattened breaklines, hydro-flattened Bare Earth DEMs, Digital Surface Models, and Intensity Images. \n   \tGeographic Extent: AOI was located along an area of coastal Louisiana referred to as Chenier Plain, which includes portions of Calcasieu, Cameron, Vermillion, Iberia, and St. Mary Parishes. The area of interest covered approximately 2942 square miles. Dataset Description: LA Chenier Plain Lidar 2017 B16 project called for the planning, acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.70 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Lidar Base Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), UTM Zone 15N, Meter and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), Meter. Lidar data was delivered as: flightline-extent raw LAS v1.4 swaths, classified point cloud LAS v1.4 files formatted to 3817 individual 1,500 m x 1,500 m tiles in NAD83 (2011), UTM Zone 15N, Meter.  Derivatives were produced as tiled; Bare Earth Surface DEMs, Digital Surface Models, Intensity Images; all tiled to the same 1,500 m x 1,500 m schema. \n \tGround conditions: Lidar was collected in Winter of 2017 by Aerial Services, Inc. (ASI), and WOOLPERT.  The Chenier Plain Wetland areas contain hundreds of impoundments related to aquaculture operations. These fields are flooded and contained within the impoundments on a semi-permanent basis, including during the Chenier Plain lidar acquisition timeframe. This is an understood and accepted acquisition condition. Furthermore, impoundments equal to or greater than 2 acres are treated as hydrologically flattened features within the data deliverables. Tidal Restriction: The following tide gauges were considered suitable for prediction of regional water levels within the AOI; Sabin Pass North, TX NOS (8770570), Calcasieu Pass, LA NOS (8768094), Freshwater Canal Locks, LA NOS (8766072), and Amerada Pass, LA NOS (8764227). Water levels at flight time shall were below -0.10 meters (mean seal level) for the Calcasieu Pass, LA tide gauge (8768094) in the west and -0.10 meters (mean seal level) for the Amerada Pass, LA tide gauge (8764227). Meteorological: Acquisition did not occur after passage of a moderate to strong high-pressure system generating northerly winds in excess of five (5) knots. In addition, it is noted switching of winds from WNW to ENE is a tipping point for switching from wind driven marsh drainage to marsh flooding. Ground Conditions: Within the extreme eastern AOI (swamp and fresh to intermediate marsh occurring northeast of Marsh Island and bordering East Cote Blanche Bay) Lidar was not acquired when the Lower Atchafalaya River stage was less than 4 feet as determined by the latest measurements taken at gauge (USGS 07381605) at Morgan City. \nLidar was not acquired when regional precipitation driven flooding occurred in local rivers with significant impact to wetland impoundments located throughout the entire Chenier Plain west of Cote Blanch Bay. The following local rivers shall be monitored for flood conditions; Vermillion, Mermentau, Calcasieu, and Sabine rivers. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established a total of 68 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area.

For this reason a hydro-flattened DEM IMG and Intensity Image was generated. There will be no LAS 1.4 for tiles 15RXQ330320 and 15RXQ405950. The DEM IMG/Intensity tiff file count is 5903. The LAS 1.4 count is 5901. \n   Ground Conditions: Initial collection of lidar data took place January and February of 2016. During this time some significant precipitation events occurred in the region and led to increased water levels in the Mississippi River and surrounding low-lying areas.  Due to these high water levels it was determined that data acquisition be postponed until water levels lowered.  Approximately 80% of the AOI had been acquired at this point. The remaining 20% was collected in January of 2017. Some water level differences will be observed in the point cloud and DEM data due to the differing collection dates, specifically in the low-lying areas near the Mississippi River.  Woolpert has taken great care to limit the amount of temporal differences between the two collection dates. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established a total of 103 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. Additional independent accuracy checkpoints were collected (120 NVA points and 90 VVA points) and used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data. Due to temporal variability, visible artifacts in the project DEM are evident within a historical floodplain along a portion of the Mississippi River. Lidar acquisition occurred when river levels were below action stage per NOAA flood gauge readings, however, some areas within the floodplain exhibited higher water levels during the January 2016 flights than what is observed in the January 2017 flights. This is specifically evident within oxbow streams and lakes found within the floodplain. Visible elevation variability in the DEM is located approximately within a bounding box of -91.36 degrees East Longitude, 31.85 degrees North Latitude; -91.24 West Longitude; 31.74 South Latitude.\n\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) downloaded 5901 MS_NatchezTrace_2016 laz files from this USGS site: ftp://rockyftp.cr.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/LPC/Projects/USGS_LPC_MS_NatchezTrace_2016_LAS_2017/ and processed the data to the Data Access Viewer (DAV) and https. \n\nIn addition to these lidar point data, the bare earth Digital Elevation Models (DEM) created from the lidar point data are also available.

The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. The data delivered in this task order is compliant with US. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Lidar Base Specification Version 1.2. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, 4 feet pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and Intensity data delivered in 5,000ft x 5,000ft tiles. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, bridge abutment breakline data, control data, and tile index provided as ESRI shapefile, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Please note that tile 29261 is a coastal tile and contains no lidar points.  The data boundary intersects this tile and a hydro breakline was digitized based on this boundary.  For this reason a hydro-flattened DEM IMG was generated. There will be no LAS 1.4 or Intensity Tiff for tile 29261. The DEM IMG file count is 768. The LAS 1.4/Intensity Tiff file count is 767.

Data are classified as 1 (valid non-ground topographic data), 2 (valid ground topographic data), and 29 (valid bathymetric data). Classes 1 and 2 are defined in accordance with the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) classification standards. These data were collected by the Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging Lidar (CZMIL) system. CZMIL integrates a lidar sensor with simultaneous topographic and bathymetric capabilities, a digital camera and a hyperspectral imager on a single remote sensing platform for use in coastal mapping and charting activities. Native lidar data is not generally in a format accessible to most Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages are used to process the native lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. The 3-D position data are sub-divided into a series of LAS files, which are tiled into quarter-quads or 5 km boxes.

Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base LIDAR Specification, Version 1.2. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format. Corresponding 2.5-foot intensity images in GeoTIFF format and 2.5-foot bare-earth DEM files in ERDAS .IMG format were created with the same tile schema. Tiles names follow the US National Grid naming schema. Hydro-flattened breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Continuous contours with a 1-foot interval were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. \n\nGround Conditions: Lidar was collected in winter of 2016, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels\n\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) received the data for processing to the Data Access Viewer (DAV) and https. In addition to the lidar point data, the bare earth Digital Elevation Models (DEM) created from the lidar point data are also available from the DAV.

This task order requires lidar data to be acquired over the Tift and Cook Counties, GA area of interest (AOI), and will be acquired as part of this task order. The total area of the Tift and Cook Counties, GA AOI is approximately 515 square miles. The lidar data acquisition parameters for this mission are detailed in the lidar processing report for this task order. The lidar data will be acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, four (4) foot pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface ESRI Grid Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, flightline vectors, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format.

This task order requires lidar data to be acquired over the Lowndes County, GA area of interest (AOI), and will be acquired as part of this task order. The total area of the Lowndes County, GA AOI is approximately 500 square miles. The lidar data acquisition parameters for this mission are detailed in the lidar processing report for this task order. The lidar data will be acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, four (4) foot pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface ESRI Grid Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, flightline vectors, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format.

The LiDAR survey occurred between June 26, 2015 and July 3, 2015 utilizing a Leica ALS70 mounted in a Cessna Grand Caravan. The systems were programmed to emit single pulses at around 198 kHz and flown at 1,400 m AGL, capturing a scan angle of 15 degrees from nadir. These settings were developed to yield points with an average native density of greater than eight pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces.\n\nFinal products created include 3-inch orthophotos, RGB extracted (from NAIP imagery) LiDAR point cloud data, three foot digital elevation models of highest hit and bare earth ground models, 1.5 foot intensity rasters, study area vector shapes, and corresponding statistical data. Final deliverables were projected in Oregon Statewide Lambert Conformal Conic. Lidar point clouds were projected back to geographic coordinates for storage in the Digital Coast Data Access Viewer.\n\nOriginal contact information: \n   Contact Name: Jacob Edwards\n   Contact Org: DOGAMI\n   Phone: 971-673-1557\n   Email: jacob.edwards@oregon.gov\nThis data set is an LAZ (compressed LAS) format file containing LIDAR point cloud data.\n\t\t" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -123.834426, 42.549299, 0.0 ], [ -123.419985, 42.549299, 0.0 ], [ -123.419985, 42.896245, 0.0 ], [ -123.834426, 42.896245, 0.0 ], [ -123.834426, 42.549299, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

This project required lidar data to be acquired over Horry County, South Carolina. The total area of the Horry County Elevation Data and Imagery AOI is approximately 1092 square miles. Lidar data was collected and processed to meet the requirements of the project task order. The lidar collection was a collaborative effort between two data acquisition firms. While Woolpert was responsible for collection of the majority of the county, the coastal portion of the data was collected by Quantum Geospatial and is detailed in the processing steps of the metadata. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, four (4) foot pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow. The bare earth DEMs along the coast may have a variance in the water heights due to temporal differences during the lidar data acquisition and will be represented in DEM as a seam-like anomaly. One coastal elevation was applied to entire project area. Due to differing acquisition dates and thus differing tide levels there will be areas in the DEM exhibiting what appears to be \"digging\" water features. Sometimes as much as approximately 2.5 feet. This was done to ensure that no coastal hydro feature was \"floating\" above ground surface. This coastal elevation will also affect connected river features wherein a sudden increase in flow will be observed in the DEM to accommodate the coastal elevation value. During Hydrologic breakline collection, Woolpert excluded obvious above-water piers or pier-like structures from the breakline placement. Some features extend beyond the apparent coastline and are constructed in a manner that can be considered an extension of the ground. These features were treated as ground during classification and subsequent hydrologic delineation. In all cases, professional practice was applied to delineate what appeared to be the coast based on data from multiple sources; Due to the many substructures and the complexity of the urban environment, interpolation and apparent \"divots\" (caused by tinning) may be evident in the surface of the bare earth DEM. In all cases, professional practice was applied to best represent the topography.

CZMIL integrates a lidar sensor with simultaneous topographic and bathymetric capabilities, a digital camera and a hyperspectral imager on a single remote sensing platform for use in coastal mapping and charting activities. Native lidar data is not generally in a format accessible to most Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages are used to process the native lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, provided in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 National Adjustment of 2011 (NAD83 NA2011). Vertical positions are referenced to the NAD83 NA11 ellipsoid and provided in meters. The National Geodetic Survey's (NGS) GEOID12A model is used to transform the vertical positions from ellipsoid to orthometric heights referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88) and OCM transforms the heights back to ellipsoid for data storage.\n\nThis data was provided to the NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) for data distribution from the Data Access Viewer (DAV). In addition to these lidar point data, the bare earth Digital Elevation Models (DEM) created from the lidar point data are also available.

This task order requires lidar data to be acquired over two counties in New York State; Suffolk and Nassau. The total area of the Long Island Sandy Lidar AOI is approximately 1,225 square miles. The lidar data will be acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Collected swath files that were that were larger than 2GB were provided in multiple sub-swath files, each less than 2GB. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. The tide window requirements for the lidar data acquisition; Tidally impacted waters within the AOI are expected to be acquired at Predicted MLW +- 2 hours exclusive of neap tide.; The bare earth DEMs along the coast may have a variance in the water heights due to temporal differences during the lidar data acquisition and will be represented in DEM as a seam-like anomaly.; One coastal elevation was applied to entire project area. Due to differing acquisition dates and thus differing tide levels there will be areas in the DEM exhibiting what appears to be \"digging\" water features. Sometimes as much as approximately 1 meter. This was done to ensure that no coastal hydro feature was \"floating\" above ground surface.; During Hydrologic breakline collection, Woolpert excluded obvious above-water piers or pier-like structures from the breakline placement. Some features extend beyond the apparent coastline and are constructed in a manner that can be considered an extension of the ground. These features were treated as ground during classification and subsequent hydrologic delineation. In all cases, professional practice was applied to delineate what appeared to be the coast based on data from multiple sources; Due to the many substructures and the complexity of the urban environment, interpolation and apparent \"divots\" (caused by tinning) may be evident in the surface of the bare earth DEM. In all cases, professional practice was applied to best represent the topography. \n\n\nOriginal contact information: \n   Contact Org: Woolpert\n   Phone: (937) 461-5660\nThis data set is an LAZ (compressed LAS) format file containing LIDAR point cloud data.\n\t\t" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -73.7667, 40.5782, 0.0 ], [ -71.8583, 40.5782, 0.0 ], [ -71.8583, 41.2909, 0.0 ], [ -73.7667, 41.2909, 0.0 ], [ -73.7667, 40.5782, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the second-generation Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar, a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 55 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters, resulting in a laser swath of approximately 240 meters with an average point spacing of 0.5-1.6 meters. The nominal vertical elevation accuracy expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE) is 13.5 centimeters on Saint Croix. Data were insufficient to calculate the nominal vertical elevation accuracy expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE) on Saint Thomas. A peak sampling rate of 15-30 kilohertz results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. More than 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission.

This task order required lidar data to be acquired in two separate AOI's over 10 counties in Mississippi; Attala, Leake, Lexington, Montgomery, Scott, Smith, Webster Counties and a portion of Carroll, Choctaw and Jasper Counties and two counties in Alabama; Washington and Choctaw. AOI is approximately 7,400 square miles. The lidar data were acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified.

This task order requires lidar data to be acquired over several areas in New York State to include the entire counties of Bronx, Kings, New York, Richmond, and Queens. Governors, Hoffman, and Swinburne Islands are part of the New York area of interest (AOI), and will be acquired as part of this task order. The total area of the New York Sandy Lidar AOI is approximately 304 square miles. Woolpert acquired lidar data of New York City as part of a task order for the NGA. The flight plan for the New York City NGA Lidar task order was developed with 11 additional cross flights over the Manhattan Metropolitan area to minimize data shadowing and data voids in the lidar dataset caused by tall buildings. The lidar data for the NGA task order was acquired between August 5, 2013 and August 15, 2013. USGS requested use of this data from the NGA, in order to reduce the duplication of lidar data acquisition effort on the New York CMGP Sandy Lidar task order. The NGA approved the use of this lidar data for the USGS task order.Following the approval by NGA, Woolpert was able to utilize the cross flights acquired as part of the NGA task order to minimize data shadowing and data voids caused by tall buildings in the USGS New York CMGP Sandy Lidar task order AOI. The cross flights used in the New York CMGP Sandy 0.7M NPS Lidar Processing task order from the NGA New York City task order were flown on August 6, 2013. The lidar data acquisition parameters for this mission are detailed in the lidar processing report for this task order. The lidar data will be acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Collected swath files that were that were larger than 2GB were provided in multiple sub-swath files, each less than 2GB. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. The tide window requirements for the lidar data acquisition; Tidally impacted waters within the AOI are expected to be acquired at Predicted MLW +- 2 hours exclusive of neap tide.; The bare earth DEMs along the coast may have a variance in the water heights due to temporal differences during the lidar data acquisition and will be represented in DEM as a seam-like anomaly.; One coastal elevation was applied to entire project area. Due to differing acquisition dates and thus differing tide levels there will be areas in the DEM exhibiting what appears to be \"digging\" water features. Sometimes as much as approximately 1 meter. This was done to ensure that no coastal hydro feature was \"floating\" above ground surface. This coastal elevation will also affect connected river features wherein a sudden increase in flow will be observed in the DEM to accommodate the coastal elevation value; During Hydrologic breakline collection, Woolpert excluded obvious above-water piers or pier-like structures from the breakline placement. Some features extend beyond the apparent coastline and are constructed in a manner that can be considered an extension of the ground. These features were treated as ground during classification and subsequent hydrologic delineation. In all cases, professional practice was applied to delineate what appeared to be the coast based on data from multiple sources; Due to the many substructures and the complexity of the urban environment, interpolation and apparent \"divots\" (caused by tinning) may be evident in the surface of the bare earth DEM. In all cases, professional practice was applied to best represent the topography. \n\nNOAA OCM has not received any finalized DEMs for this project and do not expect to, therefore any request for these should be directed to USGS' National Map or a contact at Woolpert directly (as listed below).\nThis data set is an LAZ (compressed LAS) format file containing LIDAR point cloud data.\n\t\t" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -74.258875, 40.4953623, 0.0 ], [ -73.69909, 40.4953623, 0.0 ], [ -73.69909, 40.9177328, 0.0 ], [ -74.258875, 40.9177328, 0.0 ], [ -74.258875, 40.4953623, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

This data set is one component of a digital terrain model (DTM) for St. Johns County. The dataset is comprised of mass points, 2-D and 3-D breakline features, 1-foot and 2-foot contours, ground control, vertical test points, and a footprint of the data set, in the ESRI ArcGIS File Geodatabase format.  In accordance with the counties specifications, the following breakline features are contained within the database: closed water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, etc) as 3-D polygons; linear hydrographic features (streams, shorelines, canals, swales, embankments, etc) as 3-D breaklines; coastal shorelines as 3-D linear features; edge of pavement road features as 3-D breaklines; soft features (ridges, valleys, etc.) as 3-D breaklines; island features as 3-D polygons; concretedam, culvert, footprint, lowconfidence, lowconfidenceanno, overpass, pipe, roadcenterlineoverbridge and swamppoint as 2-D features. Contours were generated from LiDAR ground class and breaklines and meet National Map Accuracy Standards. The LiDAR masspoints are delivered in the LAS file format based on the Florida statewide 5,000' by 5,000' grid. The GEOID model used to reduce satellite derived elevations to orthometric height is GEOID12A. Breakline features were captured to develop a hydrologically correct DTM. The coastalshoreline has a constant value of -0.6â that was statistically derived from the LiDAR point cloud collected within the 2-hour window of MLL tide. 2008 Hydrographic and soft features were used to supplement the 2013 breaklines in Low Confidence areas.\n\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) received the lidar point data from St. Johns County GIS in March 2018 and processed the data to be available for download from the Data Access Viewer (DAV) and via https .

The final products include files containing classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Collected swath files that were that were larger than 2GB were provided in multiple sub-swath files, each less than 2GB. The LiDAR data was provided in 1,500 meters x 1,500 meters tiles in the UTM projection. The LiDAR tile file names were derived from the southwest corner of each tile and are named based on the US National Grid. Product specifics can be found in the processing description section of this file. Ground conditions: No snow; Leaf off. The tide window requirements for the lidar data acquisition; Tidally impacted waters within the AOI are expected to be acquired at Predicted MLW +- 2 hours exclusive of neap tide.; The bare earth DEMs along the coast may have a variance in the water heights due to temporal differences during the lidar data acquisition and will be represented in DEM as a seam-like anomaly. This is especially true in areas of tidal flats. One coastal elevation was applied to entire project area. Due to differing acquisition dates and thus differing tide levels there will be areas in the DEM exhibiting what appears to be \"digging\" water features. Sometimes as much as approximately 1 meter. This was done to ensure that no coastal hydro feature was \"floating\" above ground surface. This coastal elevation will also affect connected river features wherein a sudden increase in flow will be observed in the DEM to accommodate the coastal elevation value; During Hydrologic breakline collection, Woolpert excluded obvious above-water piers or pier-like structures from the breakline placement. Some features extend beyond the apparent coastline and are constructed in a manner that can be considered an extension of the ground. These features were treated as ground during classification and subsequent hydrologic delineation. In all cases, professional practice was applied to delineate what appeared to be the coast based on data from multiple sources; Cranberry bogs are existent in the project. These are filled with shallow water for short periods during the year but were not collected as hydrologic features; Due to the many substructures and the complexity of the urban environment, interpolation and apparent \"divots\" (caused by tinning) may be evident in the surface of the DEM. Temporal differences from lidar collects in and around hydrologic features may manifest in the DEM as differing water levels. In all cases, professional practice was applied to best represent the topography. Data for the task order is referenced to the UTM Zone 19N, North American Datum of 1983 (2011), and NAVD88, in meters.

The DCPP San Simeon project study area is located primarily in San Luis Obispo County, California, encompasses approximately 195,000 acres (801 km2), and measures 75 miles in length.  Watershed Sciences, Inc. (WSI) collected Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data and orthophotography across the DCPP San Simeon survey area from 29 January 2013 to 25 February 2013. For optimal capture of the intertidal zone, WSI acquired LiDAR data of the coastline during seasonal low tides between 7 February 2013 and 10 February 2013.    The LiDAR survey utilized a Leica ALS70 sensor in a Cessna Caravan, and an Optech Orion sensor in a Bell Long Ranger. The Leica system was used for acquisition of the inland portion of the study area. It was set to acquire 240,000 laser pulses per second (i.e., 240 kHz pulse rate) and flown at 1,100 meters above ground level (AGL), capturing a scan angle of +/- 15 degrees from nadir. The Orion system was used to acquire the intertidal portion of the study area. It was set to acquire 175,000 laser pulses per second and flown at 300 meters AGL; capturing a scan angle of +/- 13 degrees from nadir. Both laser systems were programmed to yield an average native pulse density of more than 8 pulses per sq meter over terrestrial surfaces.    Digital orthophotos were collected using a 260 megapixel ultra large format digital aerial camera. Image radiometric values were calibrated to specific gain and exposure settings associated with each capture using Microsoft's UltraMap software suite. The calibrated images were saved in TIFF format for input to subsequent processes. Photo position and orientation were calculated by linking the time of image capture, the corresponding aircraft position and attitude, and the smoothed best estimate of trajectory (SBET) data in POSPAC. Within the Inpho software suite, automated aerial triangulation was performed to tie images together and to align with ground control. The orthophotos were delivered in 0.375 USGS tiles with a 3 inch pixel resolution.   This survey was flown in conjunction with the DCPP Senior Seismic Hazard Analysis Committee (SSHAC) Level 3 process and as part of the DCPP Long-Term Seismic Program (LTSP).

The LiDAR survey utilized a Leica ALS60 mounted in either a Cessna Caravan 208B or a Partenavia P.68 aircraft. The systems were programmed to emit single pulses at 105 kHz and flown at 900 m AGL, capturing a scan angle of 30 degrees from nadir. These settings were developed to yield points with an average native density of greater than eight pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. The study area was surveyed with opposing flight line side-lap of greater than 60% with at least 100% overlap to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface laser painting. The system allows up to four range measurements per pulse, and all discernible laser returns were processed for the output dataset.\n\nFinal products included lidar point cloud data, one-meter digital elevation models of bare earth ground model and highest-hit returns, intensity rasters, study area vector shapes, and corresponding statistical data.

The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 55 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters, resulting in a laser swath of approximately 240 meters with an average point spacing of 0.5-1.6 meters. The nominal vertical elevation accuracy expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE) is 25 centimeters. A peak sampling rate of 15-30 kilohertz results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. More than 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission.

Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the second-generation Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL-B), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 55 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters, resulting in a laser swath of approximately 240 meters with an average point spacing of 0.5 - 1.6 meters. The nominal vertical elevation accuracy expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE) is 20 centimeters. A peak sampling rate of 15 - 30 kilohertz results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3-to-4-hour mission. When resultant elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they provide a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development.\nOriginal contact information: \n   Contact Name: Xan Fredericks\n   Contact Org: Cherokee Nation Technology Solutions, U.S. Geological Survey, St. Petersburg Coastal and Marine Science Center, St. Petersburg, FL\n   Title: Lidar Validation and Processing Analyst\n   Phone: 727 502-8086\n   Email: afredericks@usgs.gov\nThis data set is an LAZ (compressed LAS) format file containing LIDAR point cloud data.\n\t\t" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -74.9999856, 38.84877268, 0.0 ], [ -73.93982939, 38.84877268, 0.0 ], [ -73.93982939, 40.5568922, 0.0 ], [ -74.9999856, 40.5568922, 0.0 ], [ -74.9999856, 38.84877268, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the second-generation Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL-B), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 55 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters, resulting in a laser swath of approximately 240 meters with an average point spacing of 0.5 - 1.6 meters. The nominal vertical elevation accuracy expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE) is 20 centimeters. A peak sampling rate of 15 - 30 kilohertz results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be surveyed easily within a 3-to-4-hour mission.

The data were provided to OCM, classified as:\nUnclassified (1), Ground (2), Low Point (Noise) (7), Water (9), Breakline Edge (10), Overlap Unclassified (17) and Overlap Ground (18).\n\nThe classifications available for download from the Digital Coast are:\nUnclassified (1), Ground (2), Low Point (Noise) 7, Water (9), Removed Ground (breakline edge) (10), and Overlap (12).\n\nThe collection conditions were cloud and fog-free between the aircraft and the ground; streams must be within their banks; and\nlow tide acquisition if at all possible.\n\nData voids within a single swath were avoided whenever possible. Acceptable void areas are caused by a water body;\nareas of low near infrared (NIR) reflectivity such as asphalt or composition roofing and where appropriately filled in by another swath.\nUnfortunately, during the LiDAR acquisition there were a few mountain peaks where the clouds never lifted high enough to collect LiDAR.\n\nIn order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Photo Science, Inc. established control points that\nwere used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established on Tutuila.

The remaining energy at the water's surface propogates through the water column and reflects off the\nsea bottom and back to the airborne detector.  The time difference between the surface return and the bottom return corresponds to water depth.  The maximum depth\nthe system is able to sense is related to the complex interaction of radiance of bottom material, incident sun angle and intensity, and the type and quantity of organics\nor sediments in the water column.

Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the NASA Experimental Advanced\nAirborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy,\nand coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the\naircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected\nlaser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately\n300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of +/-15\ncentimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline\ncan be surveyed easily within a 3- to 4-hour mission.

Data coverage generally extends along the coastline from the waterline offshore 1,000 meters or to laser extinction. Exclusively on areas where Fugro Pelagos acquired or planned to acquire multibeam sonar data by December 31, 2009, data coverage extends from the shoreline either to the 10-m contour, the 20-m contour or the landward extend of the multibeam data plus an additional 100 m offshore. The SHOALS system has a pulse repetition rate of 1 kHz at 532 nm (green wavelength). Native lidar data is not generally in a format accessible to most Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages are used to process the native lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, provided in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83). Vertical positions are referenced to the NAD83 ellipsoid and provided in meters. The National Geodetic Survey's (NGS) GEOID09 model is used to transform the vertical positions from ellipsoid to orthometric heights referenced to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88). The 3-D position data are sub-divided into a series of ASCII file products, with each covering approximately 5 kilometers of shoreline. The file index is provided by the shape file, \"CA_Boxes\", and the numbers used to identify files are in the \"Box\" field of the shape file. The data file naming convention is based on the year, project, area name, \"Box\" number and product type (H - bathymetry). An example file name is \"2009_NCMP_CA_001_H.xyz\", where <2009> is the project year, <NCMP> is the project under which data were collected, <CA> is the area of data collection, <001> is the \"Box\" number and <H> is the product type.

The LiDAR will be used to support hydraulic modeling work associated with proposed 2014 Columbia River treaty negotiations. The dataset encompasses approximately 2836 square miles of territory in portions of Oregon, Washington, Idaho and Montana within the Columbia River drainage. This survey was under the jurisdiction of three Corps districts: Portland (CENWP), Seattle (CENWS), and Walla Walla (CENWW). CENWP was the project lead and primary contracting organization.\n\nBare earth point data are classified as either ground (2), model key point (8) or water (9) and represent the earth's surface with all vegetation and human-made structures removed. Model key points were generated to represent the bare earth surface within a 0.07 m tolerance. Ground points (class 2) are the remaining ground points not classed as model key. Both ground and model key classes are needed for display of all bare earth points. Water classification was used for those bare earth/ground classified points that fell inside a water boundary as determined using softcopy photogrammetry with stereograms generated from LiDAR intensities. All remaining points received the default classification (1). In some areas of heavy vegetation or forest cover, there may be relatively few ground points in the LiDAR data.\n\nThe RMSE of the data for open, hard-packed surfaces is 0.046 meters as assessed from 40,266 ground survey (real time kinematic) points taken on hard-packed road surfaces. This value is representative of anticipated accuracies in open, evenly sloped or flat terrain where maximum point densities were achieved.\n\nThe project was completed for the US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District, to support hydraulic modeling related to the ACOE Columbia River Treaty project. Data acquisition, bare earth processing, and development of final tiled LiDAR deliverables and DEM's was performed by Watershed Sciences, Inc. Overall project management, photogrammetric quality control review using LiDAR stereograms, water delineation and breakline development was performed by David C. Smith & Associates, Inc. Professional Surveyor oversight of ground control data, ground control data processing and ground control publication was performed by David Evans and Associates, Inc. Final quality control review in ArcGIS of all final deliverables, including preparation of point density rasters and reach based geo-databases incorporating all deliverables, was performed by CC Patterson and Associates.\n\nNOTE ON DATUM ISSUES: All ground control and subsequent LiDAR data deliverables were developed and delivered at NAD '83 CORS 96 horizontal and NAVD '88 Geoid '09 vertical datums as processed in OPUS-DB. Due to limitations in the transformations supported by ESRI, NAD '83 and NAVD '88 datums were temporarily assigned to the ESRI deliverables and ESRI .prj file even though the actual coordinate values in the data files are at the original NAD '83 CORS 96 and NAVD '88 Geoid '09 datums. In many instances, a temporary assignment of NAD '83 HARN or HPGN may better approximate local conditions. Plain NAD '83 was used for the primary deliverable in order to avoid any implication of higher precision; however, the user may want to evaluate other approximations for specific applications. At such time as ESRI includes support for NAD '83 CORS '96, the temporary NAD '83 assignment in the .prj file should be replaced with NAD '83 CORS '96 without further reprojection.\n\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management has converted the data to ellipsoid heights (using Geoid09) and NAD 83 geographic coordinates for data storage and Digital Coast provisioning purposes.\n\nIn addition to these lidar point data, the bare earth Digital Elevation Models (DEM) created from the lidar point data, and the breaklines are also available.

Data coverage includes the barrier islands and mainland coast between Icy Cape and the U.S.âCanadian border, from the shoreline to ~1.5 km inland. Data coverage extends further inland to around 3 km on the Barrow Peninsula and along the coast of the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA) where coastal erosion rates are among the highest in the world (> 18 m/yr).

Information to create this record was found here: https://topotools.cr.usgs.gov/posters/arctic_coast_alaska.pdf and from the tile metadata for AK_Coastal_2009_000001 at USGS EarthExplorer.\n \nThis 2009 data set is part of the USGS assessment of coastal change hazards, over 11,000 km2 of airborne lidar elevation data were collected along the Arctic coast of Alaska between 2009 and 2012. Data coverage includes the barrier islands and mainland coast between Icy Cape and the U.S.âCanadian border, from the shoreline to ~1.5 km inland. Data coverage extends further inland to around 3 km on the Barrow Peninsula and along the coast of the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA) where coastal erosion rates are among the highest in the world (> 18 m/yr). Nominal point density is 1.5 m and vertical accuracy is better than 30 cm. Data were not collected over most river deltas or large embayments, with the exception of Admiralty Bay, Smith Bay (Ikpikpik Delta), Kogru River, and the Fish Creek portion of Colville River Delta. The primary use of the lidar data is to establish a modern shoreline position to be used for change analyses with historical shoreline positions. However, the lidar DEM provides a wealth of topographic and intensity data that can be used for morphological mapping of the remote arctic coast.\nThis is one of the first comprehensive lidar datasets collected in a continuous permafrost environment. Many periglacial landscape features, such as patterned ground, ice-wedge polygons, and thermokarst lakes and former lake basins (recent and relict) are discernible in the dataset. Traditional coastal landscape features including shoreline position, beach width, slope, and bluff height and morphology are also distinct.\n\nAcquired by Aerometric, Alaska; Funded by USGS National Geospatial Program, Coastal and Marine Geology Program, Alaska Science Center; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arctic Landscape Conservation Cooperative; U.S. Bureau of Land Management \n\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) downloaded this lidar data from the AK DGGS site (https://elevation.alaska.gov/) and processed the data to be available on the Digital Coast Data Access Viewer (DAV).

Elevation measurements were collected over the area using the Experimental Advanced Airborne\nResearch Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an aircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal\ntopography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's surface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage.\nThe laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The\nplane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately 300 meters, resulting in a laser swath of\napproximately 240 meters with an average point spacing of 2-3 meters. The EAARL, developed originally by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia,\nmeasures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher, results in an extremely dense spatial\nelevation dataset. Over 100 kilometers of coastline can be easily surveyed within a 3- to 4-hour mission.

The LiDAR sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies.The LiDAR systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. This data was collected at a resolution of one point per square meter. The final products include reflective surface, first, last, and at least one intermediate return, a bare earth model, and intensity data in separate files.\n\nThe reflective surface data represents the DEM created by the laser energy reflected from the first surface encountered by the laser pulse. Some energy may continue beyond this initial surface, to be reflected by a subsequent surface as represented by the last return data. Intensity information is captured from the reflective surface pulse and indicates the relative energy returned to the sensor, as compared to the energy transmitted. The intensity image is not calibrated or normalized but indicates differences in energy absorption due to the the interaction of the surface materials with laser energy, at the wavelength transmitted by the sensor. The bare earth model is created by identifying the returns that fall on the ground surface and by interpolating a surface between these points. In this manner, buildings and vegetation are removed from the bare earth model. This data set does not include bridges and overpasses in the bare earth model as the delineation point for these structures is not reliably discernible in the LiDAR data.\nThis data set is an LAZ (compressed LAS) format file containing LIDAR point cloud data.\n\t\t" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -84.158227, 42.011439, 0.0 ], [ -82.859494, 42.011439, 0.0 ], [ -82.859494, 42.473937, 0.0 ], [ -84.158227, 42.473937, 0.0 ], [ -84.158227, 42.011439, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

The first type is LiDAR  and the second one is Auto-correlation DEM. Auto-correlation DEM data was developed wherever LiDAR data was not available. LiDAR data was made available to this project through two different initiatives. The first set of LiDAR data was made available through HMTAP-1650 project, which consisted of area of 3 miles buffers around Mohawk River. Though data was available for the whole length of Mohawk, only data that pertained to the county was used for this project.The second set of LiDAR data was made available for DFIRM. DFIRM data was delivered at two different times. The first delivery done in 2008 (covers middle part of the county) and the second delivery done in 2009 (covers a small area in the west, around Oneida lake). As the two coverages did not have issues dealing with overlaps, they were used as they are.  For the auto correlated data, in an effort to provide an alternative to the collection of LiDAR data and utilization of the National Elevation Dataset (NED), Dewberry has tested the methodology for the generation of a photogrammetrically derived surface model appropriate for Hydrologic and Hydraulic modeling and conforming to FEMA standards.The autocorrelated surface was generated using imagery from the 2003 New York statewide collection along with the Aerial Triangulation (AT) solution provided with the source imagery. The surface was subsequently edited through manual processes and improved with breaklines in order to meet ASPRS Class 1 accuracy requirements for 4 foot contour mapping.The final terrain is named as Oneida_Terrain.gdb.

Elevation measurements\nwere collected over the area using the NASA Experimental Advanced Airborne Research Lidar (EAARL), a pulsed laser ranging system mounted onboard an\naircraft to measure ground elevation, vegetation canopy, and coastal topography. The system uses high-frequency laser beams directed at the Earth's\nsurface through an opening in the bottom of the aircraft's fuselage. The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam\nand the reception of the reflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an\nelevation of approximately 300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a\nvertical resolution of 15 centimeters. A sampling rate of 3 kilohertz or higher results in an extremely dense spatial elevation dataset. Over\n100 kilometers of coastline can be easily surveyed within a 3- to 4-hour mission. When subsequent elevation maps for an area are analyzed, they\nprovide a useful tool to make management decisions regarding land development.\n\nOriginal contact information: \n   Contact Name: David Nagle\n   Contact Org: Jacobs Technology, U.S. Geological Survey, St. Petersburg Science Center, St. Petersburg, FL\n   Title: Programmer/Analyst\n   Phone: 727-803-8747 (x3093)\n   Email: dnagle@usgs.gov\nThis data set is an LAZ (compressed LAS) format file containing LIDAR point cloud data.\n\t\t" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -87.166508, 30.353783, 0.0 ], [ -87.104073, 30.353783, 0.0 ], [ -87.104073, 30.389941, 0.0 ], [ -87.166508, 30.389941, 0.0 ], [ -87.166508, 30.353783, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

The extent of requested LiDAR area totals ~1,549,015 acres; the extent of the LiDAR area delivered covers ~1,586,385 acres. The delivered acreage for the study area is greater than the original amount due to buffering of the original AOIs for flight planning optimization. \n\nThe LiDAR survey utilized a Leica ALS50 Phase II mounted in Cessna Caravan 208B and an Optech 3100 laser system mounted in a Cessna Caravan 208. The Leica ALS50 Phase II system was set to acquire â¥105,000 laser pulses per second (i.e. 105 kHz pulse rate) and flown at 900 meters above ground level (AGL), capturing a scan angle of Â±14o  from nadir1. The Optech 3100 system was set to acquire 71,000 laser pulses per second (i.e. 71 kHz pulse rate) and flown at 900 meters above ground level (AGL) capturing a scan angle of Â±14 degrees from nadir. These settings are developed to yield points with an average native density of â¥8 points per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. The native pulse density is the number of pulses emitted by the LiDAR system. Some types of surfaces (i.e., dense vegetation or water) may return fewer pulses than the laser originally emitted.

The tidal data were processed\nusing the 1983-2001 epoch.\n\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) downloaded the depth data for this survey from the NGDC website (http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/bathymetry/hydro.html)\nas x,y,z points. The points were converted from MLLW depths to NAVD88 depths (using grid LAmobile02_8301;Louisiana/Mississippi - Eastern Louisiana\nto Mississippi Sound, Version 02 (1983-2001);0;1983-2001) using NOAA's Vertical Datum Transformation tool,\nVDatum (http://vdatum.noaa.gov/). The NAVD88 depths were then converted to ellipsoid depths (using the Geoid12a model), converted from x,y,z format\nto las format and classified as 11 (OCM bathymetry). Finally, the las files were zipped to laz format.\n\nOriginal contact information: \n   Contact Org: \nUnited States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental Satellite, Data,\nand Information Service (NESDIS), National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)\n\n   Title: \nUnited States Department of Commerce (DOC), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Environmental\nSatellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC), National Ocean Service Hydrographic Database Manager\n\n   Phone: 303-497-6390\n   Email: Hydro.Info@noaa.gov\nThis data set is an LAZ (compressed LAS) format file containing LIDAR point cloud data.\n\t\t" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -89.40697, 30.25076, 0.0 ], [ -89.16047, 30.25076, 0.0 ], [ -89.16047, 30.37355, 0.0 ], [ -89.40697, 30.37355, 0.0 ], [ -89.40697, 30.25076, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

In response, EarthData acquired the data from March 18 through April 6, 2006.\nAirborne lidar data was acquired at an altitude of 5,500'(1676.4 m) above mean terrain with a swath width of 40 degrees,\nwhich yields an average post spacing of lidar points of no greater than 6.56 ft (2 m). The project was designed to\nachieve a vertical accuracy of the lidar points at 7.09 in (18 cm) root mean square error (RMSE). The flight design\nincluded a total of seventy-seven flight lines with approximately 2,246 total line miles (3614.59 km). The lidar\ndata was acquired prior to the emergence of deciduous foliage. This is a bare earth data set.\n\nLight Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) is a method of locating objects on the ground using aerial-borne\nequipment. It is similar to RADAR or SONAR in that the two-way travel time of an energy beam reflected off an\nobject is precisely measured, but this technology uses laser light instead of radio or sound waves. This technology has\nproven very useful in remote sensing of the earth. It can be used for determining elevations of both the earth's surface\nand items (natural and man-made) on the surface.\n\nAnalysis of LiDAR data is used in detailed modeling of the earth's surface for drainage and floodplain studies,\ndetermining how a new structure will affect views from various locations, shoreline erosion studies, and other\nreasons. \"First returns\" are the first elevation value that the LiDAR sensor recorded for a given x,y coordinate.\nLikewise, \"last returns\" are the last elevation value that the LiDAR sensor recorded for a given x,y coordinate.\nThe Bare Earth Mass Points are point elevations that represent the \"bare earth.\" Features that are above the\nground - such as buildings, bridges, tree tops, etc. - are not included in these data.\n\nThe Gridded DEM is a model of the surface of the earth (no above-surface features such as buildings, tree tops, etc)\nwith a point at every 2 meters representing the average surface elevation of that area.\n\nThe LIDAR Intensity Imagery are similar to aerial photography. While not as sharp as traditional aerial photos,\nthey offer a good visual representation of the surface and various features.\n\nOriginal contact information: \n   Contact Name: Kevin Boone\n   Contact Org: Maryland Department of Natural Resources\n   Title: Chief GIS Officer\n   Phone: 410-260-8753\n   Email: kboone@dnr.state.md.us\nThis data set is an LAZ (compressed LAS) format file containing LIDAR point cloud data.\n\t\t" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -76.300698, 38.729653, 0.0 ], [ -75.688478, 38.729653, 0.0 ], [ -75.688478, 39.383359, 0.0 ], [ -76.300698, 39.383359, 0.0 ], [ -76.300698, 38.729653, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

The laser system records the time difference between emission of the laser beam and the reception of the\nreflected laser signal in the aircraft. The plane travels over the target area at approximately 50 meters per second at an elevation of approximately\n300 meters. The EAARL, developed by NASA at Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, measures ground elevation with a vertical resolution of 15\ncentimeters.

The collection dates and GPS times correspond to each having successfully collected and delivered their respective areas.  This record is a combination of the two and will highlight sections from both in order to create a complete and complementary metadata record.  The original metadata records will be available by request only.\n\nThis data set is the raw topographic LIDAR data set.  The data set contains selected base categories of geographic features, and characteristics of these features (X,Y,Z), in digital form.  The X,Y represent geographic coordinates and the Z represents elevation in meters.  The information was collected by EarthData International, LLC for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Detroit District. This collection was done on the behalf of the Lake Ontario St. Lawrence River Study by the International Joint Commission.\n\nThese data were collected by the SHOALS (Scanning Hydrographic Operational Airborne Lidar Survey) system which consists of an airborne laser transmitter/receiver capable of measuring 400 soundings per second.  The system operates from a deHavilland DHC-6 Twin Otter flying at altitudes between 200 and 400 meters with a ground speed of about 100 knots.  The SHOALS system also includes a ground-based data processing system for calculating accurate horizontal position and water depth.  Lidar is an acronym for LIght Detection And Ranging.  The system operates by emitting a pulse of light that travels from an airborne platform to the water surface where a small portion of the laser energy is backscattered to the airborne receiver.  The remaining energy at the water's surface propagates through the water column and reflects off the sea bottom and back to the airborne detector.

(QSI).  Woolpert collected lidar using their Leica HawkEye 4X (HE4X) topo-bathy lidar sensor that consists of a Chiroptera 4X (CH4X) sensor, with an additional Leica 40kHz deep bathymetric channel  to provide high density topo lidar.  The HE4X is a latest generation topographic and bathymetric lidar sensor. The system provides denser data than previous traditional bathymetric lidar systems. It is unique in its ability to acquire bathymetric lidar, topographic lidar and 4-band digital camera imagery simultaneously. The HE4X provided 300 kHz topographic data, an effective 140 kHz shallow bathymetric data and 40 kHz deep bathymetric data.  4-band 80 MP digital camera imagery was also collected simultaneously with the sensorâs RCD-30 camera.\n\nThe bathymetric and topographic lasers are independent and do not share an optical chain or receivers, so they are optimized for their specific function. As with any bathymetric lidar, maximum depth penetration is a function of water clarity and seabed reflectivity.  The HE4X is designed to penetrate to 3 times the secchi depth.  This is also represented as Dmax = 4/K, where K is the diffuse attenuation coefficient, and assuming K is between 0.1 and 0.3, a normal sea state and 15% seabed reflectance.\n\nBoth the topographic and bathymetric sub-systems use a palmer scanner to produce an elliptical scan pattern of laser points with a degree of incidence ranging from +/-14Â° (front and back) to +/-20Â° (sides), providing a 40Â° field of view.  This has the benefit of providing multiple look angles on a single pass and helps to eliminate shadowing effects. This can be of particular use in urban areas, where all sides of a building are illuminated, or for bathymetric features such as the sides of narrow water channels or features on the seafloor such as smaller objects and wrecks.  It also assists with penetration in the surf zone where the back scan passes the same ground location a couple of seconds after the front scan, allowing the areas of whitewater to shift.\n\nAll topo lidar data for this project were collected simultaneous to meet United States Geological Survey, Quality Level 1 (USGS QL1) with a minimum of 8 pts per square meter at an accuracy of 10cm RMSEz.  A minimum of 2 points per square meter were acquired for bathymetric lidar data.    For practical purposes the survey area was divided into survey blocks in each island, allowing acquisition to be conducted in the most efficient and consistent manner possible.\n\nThe data includes topobathy data in an LAS 1.4 format file along with associated bare earth digital elevation models (DEM). This file is the project specified 1 meter bare earth DEM dataset. The dataset was derived from topobathymetric data in a LAS format 1.4, point data record format 6, with the following classifications in accordance with project specifications and the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) classification standards:\n\t\t\t1 - unclassified\n\t\t\t2 - ground\n\t\t\t7 - noise\n\t\t\t40 - bathymetric bottom or submerged topography\n\t\t\t41 - water surface\n\t\t\t42 - derived water surface\n\t\t\t43 - manmade submerged feature\n\t\t\t45 - water column\n\t\t\t1 Overlap - edge clip \n\t\t\t1 Withheld - bathy land\n\nUser data values differentiates between NIR and green lasers.

Woolpert collected lidar using their Leica HawkEye 4X (HE4X) topo-bathy lidar sensor that consists of a Chiroptera 4X (CH4X) sensor, with an additional Leica 40kHz deep bathymetric channel  to provide high density topo lidar.  The HE4X is a latest generation topographic and bathymetric lidar sensor. The system provides denser data than previous traditional bathymetric lidar systems. It is unique in its ability to acquire bathymetric lidar, topographic lidar and 4-band digital camera imagery simultaneously.

High-resolution coastal elevation data is required to identify flood, hurricane, and sea-level rise inundation hazard zones and other earth science applications, such as the development of sediment transport and storm surge models. This  TBDEM consists of the best available multi-source topographic and bathymetric elevation data for the onshore and offshore areas in Northern California. The Northern California TBDEM integrates 26 different topographic and bathymetric data sources including LiDAR point clouds, hydrographic surveys, single-beam acoustic surveys, and multi-beam acoustic surveys obtained from USGS, NOAA, and USACE. The topographic and bathymetric surveys were sorted and prioritized based on survey date, accuracy, spatial distribution, and point density to develop a model based on the best available elevation data. Because bathymetric data are typically referenced to tidal datums (such as Mean High Water or Mean Low Water), all tidally-referenced heights were transformed into orthometric height based on a common geoid (Geoid09) that are normally used for mapping elevation on land based on the North American Vertical Datum of 1988. Every input data source in the TBDEM has been horizontally referenced to UTM Zone 10, NSRS2007. The spatial resolution is 1-meter with the general location ranging from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Oregon border, and extending inland to an elevation of at least +10 m and offshore to the 3-nautical-mile limit of California's State Waters. The overall temporal range of the input topography and bathymetry is 1986 to 2019. The topography surveys are from 2009-2019.  The bathymetry is from 1986-2019.

Class 2 (ground) lidar points in conjunction with the hydro breaklines and bridge breaklines were used to create a 1 meter hydro-flattened Raster DEM. \n  \tGeographic Extent: AOI was located along an area of coastal Louisiana referred to as Chenier Plain, which includes portions of Calcasieu, Cameron, Vermillion, Iberia, and St. Mary Parishes. The area of interest covered approximately 2942 square miles. Dataset Description: LA Chenier Plain Lidar 2017 B16 project called for the planning, acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.70 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Lidar Base Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011), UTM Zone 15N, Meter and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), Meter. Lidar data was delivered as: flightline-extent raw LAS v1.4 swaths, classified point cloud LAS v1.4 files formatted to 3817 individual 1,500 m x 1,500 m tiles in NAD83 (2011), UTM Zone 15N, Meter.  Derivatives were produced as tiled; Bare Earth Surface DEMs, Digital Surface Models, Intensity Images; all tiled to the same 1,500 m x 1,500 m schema. \n \tGround conditions: Lidar was collected in Winter of 2017 by Aerial Services, Inc. (ASI), and WOOLPERT.  The Chenier Plain Wetland areas contain hundreds of impoundments related to aquaculture operations. These fields are flooded and contained within the impoundments on a semi-permanent basis, including during the Chenier Plain lidar acquisition timeframe. This is an understood and accepted acquisition condition. Furthermore, impoundments equal to or greater than 2 acres are treated as hydrologically flattened features within the data deliverables.

Water levels at flight time shall were below -0.10 meters (mean seal level) for the Calcasieu Pass, LA tide gauge (8768094) in the west and -0.10 meters (mean seal level) for the Amerada Pass, LA tide gauge (8764227). Meteorological: Acquisition did not occur after passage of a moderate to strong high-pressure system generating northerly winds in excess of five (5) knots. In addition, it is noted switching of winds from WNW to ENE is a tipping point for switching from wind driven marsh drainage to marsh flooding. Ground Conditions: Within the extreme eastern AOI (swamp and fresh to intermediate marsh occurring northeast of Marsh Island and bordering East Cote Blanche Bay) Lidar was not acquired when the Lower Atchafalaya River stage was less than 4 feet as determined by the latest measurements taken at gauge (USGS 07381605) at Morgan City. \nLidar was not acquired when regional precipitation driven flooding occurred in local rivers with significant impact to wetland impoundments located throughout the entire Chenier Plain west of Cote Blanch Bay. The following local rivers shall be monitored for flood conditions; Vermillion, Mermentau, Calcasieu, and Sabine rivers. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established a total of 68 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. Additional independent accuracy checkpoints were collected (94 NVA points and 75 VVA points) and used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.\n\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) downloaded the LA_Chenier_Plain_2017 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) files from this USGS site: ftp://rockyftp.cr.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/OPR/ and processed the data to the Data Access Viewer (DAV) and https.\n\nIn addition to these bare earth Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, the lidar point data that these DEMs were created from, are also available.

The SHOALS system, with a high power laser, provided the better probability for deep sounding detections at a reduced point density (about 0.15 pts/m2); whilst the VQ-820-Q provided high density coverage (up to 8.5 pts/m2) but at reduced depth detection.\n\nThis metadata record describes the bare earth, 2 meter digital elevation model (DEM) created from the topographic and bathymetric LiDAR elevations generated from data collected with the SHOALS-1000T LiDAR system along Blue Hill Bay on the coastline of Maine. Data were collected by Fugro for NOAA OCM. The SHOALS system is a bathymetric LiDAR sensor for use in coastal mapping and charting activities because the laser's ability to penetrate the water column and detect targets up to 2.5 times the Secchi disk depth. Survey coverage was based on a delimiting polygon provided by NOAA OCM, which envelopes the area between the 0 m contour (NAVD88) down to approximated -10 meters. An additional horizontal buffer of 100 meters from the 0 m contour expanded the survey area coverage to include the adjacent emerged topography.

The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. The data delivered in this task order is compliant with US. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Lidar Base Specification Version 1.2. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, 4 feet pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and Intensity data delivered in 5,000ft x 5,000ft tiles. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified.

The areas of interest covers approximately 1,650 square miles. \nDataset Description: AK Yukon-Kuskokwim Lidar 2016 project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83, Universal Transverse Mercator, meters and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), meters. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 4877 individual 1000 m x 1000 m tiles as tiled Intensity Imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 1000 m x 1000 m schema. Please note that delivery tiles 03VVH800710 and 03VWH110340 do not contain lidar points. The data boundary minimally intersects these tiles and a hydro breakline was digitized and subsequent DEM and Intensities TIFs were generated. There is no LAS 1.4 for tiles 03VVH800710 and 03VWH110340. The DEM IMG/Intensity tiff file count is 4879. The LAS 1.4 count is 4877. \nGround Conditions: Lidar was collected in late 2016 by Kodiak Mapping of Palmer Alaska , while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Kodiak Mapping established a total of 94 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. An additional 165 independent accuracy checkpoints, 117 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (117 NVA points), 48 in Tall Grass and Brushland/Low Trees categories (48 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) downloaded 4879 img files from the USGS site: ftp://rockyftp.cr.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/OPR/AK_Yukon-Kuskokwim_2016/ and processed the data to be available on the Digital Coast Data Access Viewer (DAV).\n\nIn addition to these bare earth Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, the lidar point data that these DEMs were created from, are also available.

Class 2 (ground) lidar points in conjunction with the hydro breaklines were used to create a 1-meter hydro-flattened raster DEM.\n\nGeographic Extent: Seven counties in New York, covering approximately 4,474 total square miles. East Zone AOI is Franklin and St. Lawrence Counties, Central Zone AOI is Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, and Oswego Counties.\n\nDataset Description: New York FEMA 2016 QL2 Lidar project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed classified LAS 1.4 files formatted to 4,597 individual 1,500-meter x 1,500-meter tiles, as tiled intensity imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 1,500-meter x 1,500-meter schema. Continuous breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Contours with a 1-foot interval were produced in Esri file geodatabase format, tiled to the same 1,500-meter x 1,500-meter schema. \nGround Conditions: Lidar was collected in winter/spring of 2016/2017, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. established a total of 76 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the New York East Zone (Franklin and St. Lawrence Counties) project area. An additional 71 independent accuracy checkpoints, 71 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (59 NVA points), 59 in Forested, Brushland/Trees, and Tall Weeds/Crops categories (59 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data.  Quantum Spatial, Inc. established a total of 30 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the New York Central Zone (Lewis, Madison, Oneida, Onondaga, and Oswego Counties) project area. An additional 68 independent accuracy checkpoints, 43 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (43 NVA points), 25 in Forested, Brushland/Trees, and Tall Weeds/Crops categories (25 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.\n\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) downloaded the 5948 DEM files  (4597 files for the East Zone AOI and 1351 files for the Central Zone AOI)  from the New York State GIS site.

Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states, including the entire eastern seaboard with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York. In response to the storm, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program in collaboration with the USGS National Geospatial Program (NGP), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) developed a three-dimensional (3D) 1-meter topobathymetric elevation model (TBDEM) for the Chesapeake Bay region including the District of Columbia, states of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia and the adjacent coastline. High-resolution coastal elevation data is required to identify flood, hurricane, and sea-level rise inundation hazard zones and other earth science applications, such as the development of sediment transport and storm surge models. The new TBDEM consists of the best available multi-source topographic and bathymetric elevation data for the District of Columbia, states of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Virginia and coastal areas. The Chesapeake Bay TBDEM integrates over 261 different data sources including topographic and bathymetric LiDAR point clouds, hydrographic surveys, side-scan sonar surveys, and multi-beam surveys obtained from USGS, NOAA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other state and local agencies. The LiDAR and bathymetry surveys were sorted and prioritized based on survey date, accuracy, spatial distribution, and point density to develop a model based on the best available elevation data.

Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states, including the entire eastern seaboard with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York. In response to the storm, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program in collaboration with the USGS National Geospatial Program (NGP), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) developed a three-dimensional (3D) 1-meter topobathymetric elevation model (TBDEM) for the New England sub-region including the and adjacent coastline. High-resolution coastal elevation data is required to identify flood, hurricane, and sea-level rise inundation hazard zones and other earth science applications, such as the development of sediment transport and storm surge models. The new TBDEM consists of the best available multi-source topographic and bathymetric elevation data for New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts coastal areas.The New England TBDEM integrates over 321 different data sources including topographic and bathymetric LiDAR point clouds, hydrographic surveys, side-scan sonar surveys, and multi-beam surveys obtained from USGS, NOAA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other state and local agencies.

Class 2 (ground) lidar points in conjunction with the hydro breaklines and bridge breaklines were used to create a 1 meter hydro-flattened Raster DEM.\n      \tGeographic Extent: AOI is located in Mississippi over Warren, Hinds, Claiborne, Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Wilkinson, and Amite Counties. The area of interest covers approximately 4,780 square miles. Dataset Description: Mississippi NRCS FY16 Lidar project called for the Planning, Acquisition, processing and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.70 meter. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83, Universal Transverse Mercator, meters and vertical datum of NAVD88 (GEOID12B), meters. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files, formatted to 5303 individual 1,500m x 1,500m tiles in NAD83(2011) UTM Zone 15N, as tiled Intensity Imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 1,500m x 1,500m schema. Please note that tiles 15RXQ330320 and 15RXQ405950 do not contain lidar points.  The data boundary intersects these tiles and a hydro breakline was digitized based on this boundary.  For this reason a hydro-flattened DEM IMG and Intensity Image was generated. There will be no LAS 1.4 for tiles 15RXQ330320 and 15RXQ405950. The DEM IMG/Intensity tiff file count is 5903. The LAS 1.4 count is 5901.\nGround Conditions: Initial collection of lidar data took place January and February of 2016. During this time some significant precipitation events occurred in the region and led to increased water levels in the Mississippi River and surrounding low-lying areas.  Due to these high water levels it was determined that data acquisition be postponed until water levels lowered.  Approximately 80% of the AOI had been acquired at this point. The remaining 20% was collected in January of 2017. Some water level differences will be observed in the point cloud and DEM data due to the differing collection dates, specifically in the low-lying areas near the Mississippi River.  Woolpert has taken great care to limit the amount of temporal differences between the two collection dates. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established a total of 103 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the project area. Additional independent accuracy checkpoints were collected (120 NVA points and 90 VVA points) and used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data. Due to temporal variability, visible artifacts in the project DEM are evident within a historical floodplain along a portion of the Mississippi River. Lidar acquisition occurred when river levels were below action stage per NOAA flood gauge readings, however, some areas within the floodplain exhibited higher water levels during the January 2016 flights than what is observed in the January 2017 flights. This is specifically evident within oxbow streams and lakes found within the floodplain. Visible elevation variability in the DEM is located approximately within a bounding box of -91.36Â° East Longitude, 31.85Â° North Latitude; -91.24 West Longitude; 31.74 South Latitude.\n\nThe NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) downloaded the MS_NatchezTrace_2016 Digital Elevation Model (DEM) files from this USGS site: ftp://rockyftp.cr.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/OPR/ and processed the data to the Data Access Viewer (DAV) and https.\n\nIn addition to these bare earth Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, the lidar point data that these DEMs were created from, are also available.

Class 2 (ground) lidar points in conjunction with the hydro breaklines were used to create a 1 meter hydro-flattened raster DEM.\nGeographic Extent: Four partial counties in western Maine, covering approximately 5,034 total square miles\nDataset Description: Maine 2016 QL2 Lidar project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and derivative products of lidar data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. Project specifications are based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 1.2. The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011) UTM Zone 19, meters and vertical datum of NAVD1988 (Geoid 12B), meters. Lidar data was delivered as flightline-extent unclassified LAS swaths, as processed Classified LAS 1.4 files formatted to 6,115 individual 1,500 meter x 1,500 meter tiles, as tiled intensity imagery, and as tiled bare earth DEMs; all tiled to the same 1,500 meter x 1,500 schema. Continuous breaklines were produced in Esri file geodatabase format. Continuous contours with an interval of 1 foot were created in Esri file geodatabase format.\nGround Conditions: Lidar was collected in spring of 2016, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Quantum Spatial, Inc. utilized a total of 101 ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the Maine project area. An additional 205 independent accuracy checkpoints, 118 in Bare Earth and Urban landcovers (118 NVA points), 87 in Forested, Brushland/Trees, and Tall Weeds/Crops categories (87 VVA points), were used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.

Hurricane Sandy affected 24 states, including the entire eastern seaboard with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York. In response to the storm, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program in collaboration with the USGS National Geospatial Program (NGP), and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) developed a three-dimensional (3D) 1-meter topobathymetric elevation models (TBDEMs) for the New Jersey/Delaware sub-region including the Delaware Estuary and adjacent coastline. As part of the TBDEM, hydrologically-enforced data was included to eliminate mapping-artifact drainage impediments at select regions along the Delaware River. High-resolution coastal elevation data is required to identify flood, hurricane, and sea-level rise inundation hazard zones and other earth science applications, such as the development of sediment transport and storm surge models. The new TBDEM consists of the best available multi-source topographic and bathymetric elevation data for the New Jersey and Delaware coastal areas.The New Jersey / Delaware TBDEM integrates over 89 different data sources including topographic and bathymetric LiDAR point clouds, hydrographic surveys, side-scan sonar surveys, and multi-beam surveys obtained from USGS, NOAA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and other state and local agencies. The LiDAR and bathymetry surveys were sorted and prioritized based on survey date, accuracy, spatial distribution, and point density to develop a model based on the best available elevation data. Because bathymetric data is typically referenced to tidal referenced datums (such as Mean High Water or Mean Low Water), all tidally-referenced heights were transformed into orthometric heights that are normally used for mapping elevation on land (based on the North American Vertical Datum of 1988). The spatial resolution is 1 meter and includes the entire states of Delaware and New Jersey with subareas from other neighboring states. The temporal range of the input topography and bathymetry is 1880 to 2014.\nOriginal contact information: \n   Contact Name: Jeffrey Danielson / Dean Tyler *\n   Contact Org: U.S. Geological Survey\n   Title: Physical Geographer\n   Phone: 605-594-6148 / 605-594-2624 *\n   Email: daniels@usgs.gov / dtyler@usgs.gov *" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -76.161454, 38.442389, 0.0 ], [ -73.72734, 38.442389, 0.0 ], [ -73.72734, 41.202519, 0.0 ], [ -76.161454, 41.202519, 0.0 ], [ -76.161454, 38.442389, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

This task order requires lidar data to be acquired over the Lowndes County, GA area of interest (AOI), and will be acquired as part of this task order. The total area of the Lowndes County, GA AOI is approximately 500 square miles. The lidar data acquisition parameters for this mission are detailed in the lidar processing report for this task order. The lidar data will be acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters.

The U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) Coastal and Marine Geology Program (CMGP) and the National Geospatial Program (NGP) collaborated with the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority of Louisiana (CPRA) and a number of other federal and state agencies to create a comprehensive topobathymetric elevation model for the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGOM).

The data set was collected specific to the 2014 Phase Two project area consisting of 20 North Carolina counties which are listed below in the \"Place Keywords\" section of this metadata record. The LiDAR was collected between January 30 and March 13 of 2014, at nominal post spacing of 0.7 meters or better for a total project area of 14,500 square miles. Three sensors were used for the data collection; two Leica ALS70HP-II (serial numbers 7198 and 7123) and an Optech Pegasus HA500 (serial number 13SEN303). All data was collected during leaf-off conditions and the three coastal counties within the project area were collected during low tide conditions. Ground survey support for the project included the establishment of GPS base stations and the collection of control points used for calibration. All data was delivered in the North Carolina State Plane Coordinate System, with a horizontal datum of NAD83 (2011), vertical datum of NAVD88 (Geoid 12A), in US Survey Feet (vertical units later changed to meters). Data was delivered tiled to a 5,000 foot by 5,000 foot tiling scheme unless otherwise specified in this product description. All LiDAR was delivered in LASer (LAS) version 1.3 standard format.

These files contain classified topo/bathy lidar data. Data are classified as 1 (valid non-ground topographic data), 2 (valid ground topographic data), 7 (noise), 9 (water surface), and 29 (valid bathymetric data). Classes 1 and 2 are defined in accordance with the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ASPRS) classification standards. These data were collected by the Coastal Zone Mapping and Imaging Lidar (CZMIL) system. CZMIL integrates a lidar sensor with simultaneous topographic and bathymetric capabilities, a digital camera and a hyperspectral imagery on a single remote sensing platform for use in coastal mapping and charting activities. Native lidar data is not generally in a format accessible to most Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Specialized in-house and commercial software packages are used to process the native lidar data into 3-dimensional positions that can be imported into GIS software for visualization and further analysis. Horizontal positions, provided in decimal degrees of latitude and longitude, are referenced to the North American Datum of 1983 National Adjustment of 2011 (NAD83 NA2011). Vertical positions are referenced to the NAD83 NA11 ellipsoid and provided in meters. Vertical positions are in ellipsoid. The 3-D position data are sub-divided into a series of LAS files, which are tiled into quarter-quads or 5km boxes. DEMs were created from all classes of points (1, 2, 29) and bare earth DEMs created from the ground and bathymetric data classes (2, 29) are at a 1 meter grid size.\nOriginal contact information: \n   Contact Org: JALBTCX\n   Title: Data Production Manager\n   Phone: 228-252-1131\n   Email: JALBTCX@usace.army.mil" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -122.765533, 47.037795, 0.0 ], [ -122.20445, 47.037795, 0.0 ], [ -122.20445, 48.587715, 0.0 ], [ -122.765533, 48.587715, 0.0 ], [ -122.765533, 47.037795, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

The total area collected for Horry County, SC for this project is approximately 1092 square miles. Lidar data was collected and processed to meet the requirements of the project task order. The lidar collection was a collaborative effort between two data acquisition firms. While Woolpert was responsible for collection of the majority of the county, the coastal portion of the data was collected by Quantum Geospatial and is detailed in the processing steps of the metadata. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, four (4) foot pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow. The bare earth DEMs along the coast may have a variance in the water heights due to temporal differences during the lidar data acquisition and will be represented in DEM as a seam-like anomaly. One coastal elevation was applied to entire project area. Due to differing acquisition dates and thus differing tide levels there will be areas in the DEM exhibiting what appears to be \"digging\" water features. Sometimes as much as approximately 2.5 feet. This was done to ensure that no coastal hydro feature was \"floating\" above ground surface. This coastal elevation will also affect connected river features wherein a sudden increase in flow will be observed in the DEM to accommodate the coastal elevation value. During Hydrologic breakline collection, Woolpert excluded obvious above-water piers or pier-like structures from the breakline placement. Some features extend beyond the apparent coastline and are constructed in a manner that can be considered an extension of the ground. These features were treated as ground during classification and subsequent hydrologic delineation. In all cases, professional practice was applied to delineate what appeared to be the coast based on data from multiple sources; Due to the many substructures and the complexity of the urban environment, interpolation and apparent \"divots\" (caused by tinning) may be evident in the surface of the bare earth DEM. In all cases, professional practice was applied to best represent the topography.                                                                                                                            \n\nThe data received by the NOAA OCM are topographic data in LAS 1.2 format, classified as unclassified (1), ground (2), all noise (7), water (9), ignored ground (10), overlap unclassified (17), and overlap ground (18).

Another characteristic of the USVI lidar data that was observed on all islands is the appearance of divots where there is a single tree or a narrow line of trees that lie in areas of open, bare terrain.

This LiDAR dataset is a survey of American Samoa including the islands of Tutuila, Aunu'u, Ofu, Olosega, Ta'u and Rose Atoll.\nThe project area consists of approximately 75 square miles. The project design of the LiDAR data acquisition was developed\nto support a nominal post spacing of 1.0 meter or better (1.0 meter GSD). GMR Aerial Surveys Inc. d/b/a Photo Science, Inc.\nacquired 108 flight lines in 7 lifts between June 2012 and July 2012. This collection was for NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM).\nThe data collection was performed with a Beechcraft King Air 90 twin engine aircraft (tail number N87E) utilizing an Optech Gemini\nsensor; collecting multiple return x, y, and z as well as intensity data. The data were provided to OCM, classified as:\nUnclassified (1), Ground (2), Low Point (Noise) (7), Water (9), Breakline Edge (10), Overlap Unclassified (17) and Overlap Ground (18).\n\nThe classifications available for download from the Digital Coast are:\nUnclassified (1), Ground (2), Low Point (Noise) 7, Water (9), Removed Ground (breakline edge) (10), and Overlap (12).\n\nThe collection conditions were cloud and fog-free between the aircraft and the ground; streams must be within their banks; and\nlow tide acquisition if at all possible.\n\nData voids within a single swath were avoided whenever possible. Acceptable void areas are caused by a water body;\nareas of low near infrared (NIR) reflectivity such as asphalt or composition roofing and where appropriately filled in by another swath.\nUnfortunately, during the LiDAR acquisition there were a few mountain peaks where the clouds never lifted high enough to collect LiDAR.\n\nIn order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Photo Science, Inc. established control points that\nwere used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established on Tutuila. Please see the survey report for more details on\nground control point collection at:\nhttps://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/lidar1_z/geoid12a/data/2490/supplemental/PhotoScience-AmSam_PostFlightAcquisitionReport_FINAL.pdf\n\nThe dataset was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of UTM NAD83 (PACP00), UTM Zone 2, meters. The vertical datum\nused during the collection, varied by island. NAVD88 (ASVD02), meters was used for the island of Tutuila (and Aunu'u). NAVD1988\n(GEOID09), meters was used for the islands of Ofu, Olosega and Tau. Rose atoll was adjusted from Ellipsoid heights to a mean\nlow water (MLW) datum.

These settings were developed to yield points with an average native density of greater than eight pulses per square meter over terrestrial surfaces. The study area was surveyed with opposing flight line side-lap of greater than 60% with at least 100% overlap to reduce laser shadowing and increase surface laser painting.

In many instances, a temporary assignment of NAD '83 HARN or HPGN may better approximate local conditions. Plain NAD '83 was used for the primary deliverable in order to avoid any implication of higher precision; however, the user may want to evaluate other approximations for specific applications. At such time as ESRI includes support for NAD '83 CORS '96, the temporary NAD '83 assignment in the .prj file should be replaced with NAD '83 CORS '96 without further reprojection.\n\n\n\nOriginal contact information: \n   Contact Name: Jacob MacDonald\n   Contact Org: US Army Corps of Engineers, Portland District\n   Phone: 503-808-4844\n   Email: jacob.macdonald@usace.army.mil" }, "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ -124.125759, 44.77523, 0.0 ], [ -113.9414, 44.77523, 0.0 ], [ -113.9414, 49.004158, 0.0 ], [ -124.125759, 49.004158, 0.0 ], [ -124.125759, 44.77523, 0.0 ] ] ] } },

This metadata record describes the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) created from the lidar and multibeam data. The DEM has a 1m cell size.\nTopographic LiDAR: The topographic lidar data used in this merged project was the 2009-2011 CA Coastal Conservancy Lidar Project. The data were collected between October 2009 and August 2011. This collection was a joint effort by the NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM); the California State Coastal Conservancy (SCC) Ocean Protection Council (OPC); Scripps Institution of Oceanography; and the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Center of Expertise (JALBTCX). The data coverage extends landward 500 m from the shoreline, along the entire California coastline. The LAS classifications are as follows: 1-Unclassified, 2-Ground, 7-Noise, 9-Water, 10- Mudflats, 12-Overlap.
