# Overview

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National
Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), through its collaboration
with the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences
(CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder, develops digital
elevation models (DEMs) that range from the local to global scale.
Collectively, these elevation models are essential to determining the
timing and extent of coastal inundation and improving community
preparedness, event forecasting, and warning systems. We initiated a
comprehensive framework at NCEI, the Continuously-Updated DEM (CUDEM)
Program, to systematically generate DEMs from the local coastal
community to the global scale.

We generate the CUDEMs through a standardized process using free and
open-source software (FOSS) and provide open-access to our code
repository
([https://github.com/ciresdem](https://github.com/ciresdem)) for
consistency, transparency, and to promote accessibility. The CUDEM
framework consists of systematic tiled geographic extents, spatial
resolutions, and horizontal and vertical datums to facilitate rapid
updates of targeted areas with new data collections, especially
post-storm and tsunami events. The CUDEM Program is also enabling the
rapid incorporation of high-resolution data collections ingested into
local-scale DEMs into NOAA NCEI's suite of regional and global DEMs. The
CUDEMs are a shift from project-based DEM specifications, to a
comprehensive program that systematically and continuously develops and
updates DEMs across all spatial scales.

## CUDEM Framework

The CUDEM framework provides a set of powerful open-source command-line tools as well as a Python-3-based application programming interface (API) for ([1](/docs/fetches.md)) identifying and downloading topographic and bathymetric source data from more than forty different publicly available datasets, (2) filtering data, (3) ranking and merging multiple datasets using a variety of algorithms, (4) generating DEMs from those source datasets in a variety of data formats and projections/datums, (5) gernerating auxiliary data products including uncertainty and data mask rasters, and (6) generating metadata documentation of those DEMs. Individual components are modular and may be run standalone; for example, the CUDEM “fetches” module can download airborne lidar data, multi-beam sonar data, or nautical charts covering specific geographic regions; or the “stacks” module can efficiently combine and gap-fill raster datasets of varying qualities using customizable data lists. The CUDEM tools may also be conjoined in end-to-end workflows ensuring permanent traceability and reproducibility in DEM generation. The Coastal DEM Team uses the CUDEM framework to accurately inform and map risk assessments of coastal regions (e.g. Amante et al.)

Installation of HTDP and MB-System are system dependent, see their respective installation instructions for your system.

# Modules

The open-access code includes command-line tools and a Python
application programming interface (API) for automated data download,
processing, DEM gridding, and interpolation uncertainty grid generation
with three main software tools: "fetches", "waffles", and "dlim".
"Fetches" is the data download tool for obtaining publicly available
elevation data froma variety of sources and can optionally list, download or
process thefetched data for use in DEM generation. We download a variety of
data types, e.g., topographic-bathymetry lidar, multibeam swath sonar
bathymetry, hydrographic soundings, compiled grids, etc., from a variety
of sources, e.g., NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) Digital
Coast, NOAA NCEI NOS Hydro Surveys, NOAA NCEI Multibeam, USGS The
National Map, and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Navigation
Condition Surveys. Other data sources include digitized bathymetric
charts or topographic maps, shorelines, satellite-derived elevations,
and precisely surveyed geodetic monuments (Table 1). We typically
download data in an area slightly larger (\~5%) than the DEM extents.
This data "buffer" ensures that interpolative gridding occurs across
rather than along the DEM boundaries to prevent edge effects, which is
especially important with sparse bathymetric data with large
interpolation distances. Data buffers also minimize artificial offsets
between adjacent DEM tiles.
